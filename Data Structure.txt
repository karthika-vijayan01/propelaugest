Sorting Algorithms(3)

Explain DS using python 

Searching Algorithms(3)

Naming Convension
Pscal case --> First letter of Each Word is pascal and no space b/w word(PascalCase)
eg:MyVariableIsString
Camel case --> First letter of word is lowercase and subsequen wordsfirst letter are capitalized(camalCase)
eg:myVariableIsString

Variable in Python
Lowercase seperated by underscore(snake_case)
eg: mvar=42

functions and methods: snake_case, but use verbs

Constants : uppercase with underscore
eg :--> MAX_VAL=5

class : pascalcase or CapWord based on PEP 8 recommented(PEP: python Enhancement proposal)(both formats are same)
eg :--> MyClass

Modules : Lowecase with undercase
eg :--> my_module
private variables and methods --prifix variable and method with single underscore
eg :--> _my_private
protected variables and method -- prifix var and method with double underscore
eg :--> __my_var
global variable --> use descriptive names with uppercase and underscore
eg :--> GLOBAL_CONSTANT=3.14

camelCase  --> No Space,No Underscore
snake_case --> No Space,can Underscore
PascalCase --> No Space,No Underscore
CapWord    --> No Space,No Underscore

Why need:help to stay organized and quickly identify your files
no space for every Case

Modules(day5)
python has so many built in funs all this fns are saved in files that are called modules 
using : import fnname
Modules:->
random it has so many built in fns
import random
random.randrange #randrange()fn is part of random module use for generating random nos

COMPILER AND INTERPRETER
BOTH ARE converting high level lang(source code in python /java/c++,c#)
Compiler Whole Execution --> before running
Interpreter Line by line execution -->after running

ERRORS
Syntax Error :--> When the time of syntax is wrong,it occure pgm execute,Compile time error
eg: print("Syntax"  #  Syntax Error
Logical Error:--> Syntax is correct but code is not correct,Encounter the time of run is called Exeption,Run time error
eg: a=5/0 # logical error 

EXEPTION HANDLING
other programming language

Try  : error excepting code
try
{
a=10/0
print(a)
}

catch:error handling code 
catch
{
print(" cannot divide by 0")
}

# in python try and  except
try:
  error excepting code
except:
  code to handle errors
Finally() 
error present or not it execute
else()
it execute no error were raised
 
          exept   finally    else

error      yes      yes       no
no error    no      yes      yes
